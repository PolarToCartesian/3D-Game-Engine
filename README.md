# 3D Java Renderer

![Image Not Able To Load](screenshots/main.jpg)

## The Goal

This project's goal is to build a simple 3D java rendering engine from stratch.

## Features

+ **A Perspective Matrix**
  + *Ajustable Fov, zNear and zFar*
+ **Object Rotation Matrix**
  + *Ajustable Rotation and its center*
+ **Basic Camera**
  + *Movement*
  + *Rotation*
+ **Simple Lighting**
  + *Multiple Point Lights*
  + *Considers Distance (with the inverse square law)*
  + *Pixel Per Pixel Lighting*
  + *Light Color*
+ **Other**
  + *Each of the triangle's vertices can have different colors (with smooth transitions)*
  + *Model Loader*
  + *Depth Buffer*
